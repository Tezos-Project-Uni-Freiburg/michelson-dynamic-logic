abstract="Tezos is a blockchain launched in June 2018. It is written in OCaml and supports smart contracts. Its smart contract language is called Michelson and it has been designed with formal verification in mind. In this article, we present Mi-Cho-Coq, a Coq framework for verifying the functional correctness of Michelson smart contracts. As a case study, we detail the certification of a Multisig contract with the Mi-Cho-Coq framework.",
