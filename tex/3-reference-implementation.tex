\section{Michelson Reference Implementation}
\label{sec:refImpl}

Program execution is defined in a small-step manner by a function that maps
the current execution state of a program to a new state resulting from executing
the first instruction:
\ConcreteprogStep

The type $\ADT{CProgState}~ro$ is a record that contains an input
stack type $ri$, a program that maps an $ri$ stack to an $ro$ stack,
an input stack of type $ri$, and the execution
environment. \AFun{prog-step} executes the first instruction that must
map an $ri$ stack to an intermediate stack of type $re$,
say. Consequently, the program in the output \ADT{CProgState} maps an
$re$ stack to an $ro$ stack. As instructions as well as programs are
intrinsically typed, the intermediate stack type $re$ is sure to
match. Likewise, the typing of \AFun{prog-step} ensures type preservation.

% However, we have to add an
% instruction to represent intermediate states that arise while executing certain instructions.
% For that reason we recall their semantics from the Michelson specification
% before we present the formal definition of \ADT{ProgState}.

\subsection{Program Execution}
\label{sec:program-execution}

So far we only concerned ourselves with the type of a Michelson stack.
For program execution, both the types and values of stack elements are relevant.
To this end, we have to lift the interpretation of a single type,
i.e., a function from {\AType} to {\ASet}, to the interpretation of a
list of types. The library predicate \ADT{All} does exactly that: it
``maps'' a {\ASet}-typed function over a list, which yields (the type of) a
heterogeneously typed list.

For example, the value interpretation of a type stack is a value stack where
corresponding elements $t$ and $v$ are related by the type
interpretation, that is, $v : \ASem{t}$. 
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\linewidth}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\linewidth}
  \ExamplesInt
\end{minipage}

The definition of a program state (see \autoref{fig:prog-step-example}) abstracts over a $Mode$ which
contains a type interpretation that allows us reuse the same structure
for concrete execution and abstract execution.
A program state contains the program that is currently executed,
the stack, and an environment which provides the
context information to execute blockchain instructions like
\ACon{AMOUNT} and \ACon{BALANCE}.
It is parameterized by the output stack type, which does not change during execution.
When executing more than one contract as we demonstrate in \secref{sec:contract-execution},
this parameterization ensures that the results from completed contract executions are well typed.

\begin{figure}[tp]

  \ConcreteprogStepfct
  \caption{Program state and single program step execution (excerpt)}
  \label{fig:prog-step-example}
\end{figure}
The function \AFun{prog-step} executes the first instruction of a
program on the current state.
We explain two exemplary cases shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:prog-step-example}.  To explain the first stanza of
the code we have to make a
confession. As several instructions have very similar semantics, our
internal representation of instructions is a refinement of the
datatype shown in Figure~\ref{fig:core-michelson-instructions}. For
example, all instructions that just apply a function to the top of the
stack are grouped under a constructor \ACon{fct} and \ADT{func-type}
is the type defining these instructions.
\FunctionsInstructionfct

The function \AFun{app-fct} applies such a function to a concrete
stack. Roughly speaking, if the underlying function has type $a_1 \to \dots \to a_n \to
(r_1 \times \dots \times r_m)$ it gets transformed into a function
between heterogeneously typed lists
$[a_1, \dots, a_n] \to [r_1, \dots, r_m]$. We elide the definition and
just remark that the function $[{\times}\_]$ implements the
transformation between $(r_1 \times \dots \times r_m)$ and $[r_1,
\dots, r_m]$. The functions \AFun{H.front} and \AFun{H.rest} (in Fig.~\ref{fig:prog-step-example}) split the
input stack according to the stack types expected by the function \textit{ft}. The
function \AFun{H.++} is concatenation of heterogeneous lists.

The \ACon{DROP} instruction drops the top of the stack.


\subsection{Execution of Control Flow Instructions}\label{sec:control-flow}

We have chosen a small-step semantics because its stepwise progression
matches the stepwise proof rules of the dynamic logic. However, 
the Michelson specification defines the semantics in terms of a big-step
judgment.\footnote{For typing reasons the implementation splits it in four judgments for
  programs $\Downarrow$, instructions $\downarrow$, shadow programs $\Ddownarrow$,
  and shadow instructions $\downarrow'$.}
\BigstepConfiguration
\BigstepJudgment
It relates a configuration (environment and input stack of type $ri$) and a
program to an output stack of type $ro$.
% $p : \text{\emph{StackIn}} \mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}$.
The definition of the semantics in the Michelson specification takes
some liberties that require some extra machinery in a small-step execution
model. We discuss these issues with some representative instructions.

The instruction \ACon{IF-NONE}~\textit{p-none}~\textit{p-some} expects
a value of  type \ACon{option} on top of the stack.
If that value is \ACon{nothing} (the encoding of \ACon{NONE}), the
\textit{p-none} branch is executed on the rest of the stack:
\BigstepIfNone

% \[	\inferrule*	[Right=IF-NONE-true]
%  	{\textit{thn} : \text{\emph{StackIn}} \mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}}
%  	{\text{\ACon{IF-NONE} }\textit{thn}~\textit{els} : N\!O\!N\!E :: \text{\emph{StackIn}} 
% 		\mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}}
% \]

If however the top of the stack is $\ACon{just}~x$ (encoding $\ACon{SOME}~x$),
the \textit{p-some} branch is executed on the stack where  $\ACon{just}~x$
is replaced with $x$:
\BigstepIfSome
% \[	\inferrule*	[Right=IF-NONE-false]
% 	{\text{thn} : x :: \text{\emph{StackIn}} \mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}}
% 	{\text{\ACon{IF-NONE} thn els} : S\!\!\;O\!M\!E\; x :: \text{\emph{StackIn}} 
% 		\mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}}
% \]

To specify the corresponding small-step rule we introduce a type-respecting concatenation
operator $;\!\bullet$ on programs. 
The program $\ACon{IF-NONE}~$\textit{p-none}$~$\textit{p-some}$~;~$\textit{p-rest} either transitions to
\textit{p-none}~$;\!\bullet$~\textit{p-rest} or to \textit{p-some}~$;\!\bullet$~\textit{p-rest},
depending on the value on top of the stack.

The instruction $\ACon{DIP}~n~p$ executes program $p$ on the stack that results from removing the first $n$ elements
of the current stack and reattaches them afterwards.
\BigstepDIP
% \[	\inferrule*	[Right=DIP]
% 	{\text{prg} : \text{\emph{StackIn}} \mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}
% 	\\\\	length(\text{\emph{front}}) == \text{n}}
% 	{\text{\ACon{DIP} n prg} :	\text{\emph{front}} +\!\!\!+\; \text{\emph{StackIn}}
% 		\mapsto		\text{\emph{front}} +\!\!\!+\; \text{\emph{StackOut}} }
% \]

In the small-step version, dropping the first $n$ elements of the
stack is easy, but reattaching them requires extra machinery.
Thus, a mechanism for holding on to the top of the stack while executing the subprogram
and retrieving it afterwards is necessary.

Execution of \ACon{ITER} requires the same feature in a slightly different way.
It consumes the list on top of the current stack.
If the list is empty, it is dropped from the stack:
%
\BigstepIterNil
% \[	\inferrule*	[Right=ITER-nil]
% 	{ }
% 	{\text{\ACon{ITER} prg} : N\!I\!L :: \text{\emph{StackIn}}  \mapsto \text{\emph{StackIn}} }
% \]

Otherwise the subprogram is applied to the first list element $v$ and then
the \ACon{ITER} instruction is reissued on the rest of the list $vs$
and the current stack:
\BigstepIterCons
% \[	\inferrule*	[Right=ITER-cons]
% 	{	\text{prg} :      x  :: \text{\emph{StackIn}}  \mapsto \text{\emph{StackOut}}
% 	\\\\	\text{\ACon{ITER} prg} : xs :: \text{\emph{StackOut}} \mapsto \text{\emph{StackEnd}} }
% 	{\text{\ACon{ITER} prg} : (x :: xs) :: \text{\emph{StackIn}}  \mapsto \text{\emph{StackEnd}} }
% \]

The typing for \ACon{ITER} requires that the type of the underlying
stack is preserved, but the subprogram \textit{p-iter} is 
entitled to access and modify the stack beyond the first element $x$.
Let's now consider stepwise execution. If the list on top has the form $v
:: vs$,  we need to stash the tail list $vs$ somewhere while the subprogram
processes the stack with $v$ on top.
After execution of the subprogram,
we have to recover $vs$ and try again with \ACon{ITER}.
% we need a mechanism to retrieve the rest of the list
% and either continue iterating over it or proceed with executing the rest of the program.

As subprograms can be arbitrarily complex, in particular, they
may contain \ACon{DIP} and \ACon{ITER}, we need a nestable solution.
To this end, we add a single new instruction \ACon{MPUSH1} that pushes
a single value on the stack. This instruction is
different from the normal \ACon{PUSH} instruction, which is limited to
\ACon{Pushable} values that have a textual representation.
\ConcreteShadowInst

We call the new instruction a \emph{shadow instruction} because it does not
appear in input programs. It is indexed by two stack types like
any other instruction.
A \emph{shadow program} is defined like \ADT{Program}, but its first
instruction can be a normal instruction or a shadow instruction. Shadow programs only appear
at the top-level, never as subprograms nested in instructions. We elide the definition of
\ADT{ShadowProg} as it is analogous to \ADT{Program}. Moreover, we
provide a utility function \AFun{mpush} to generate a sequence of
\ACon{MUSH1} instructions from a list of values.
\ConcreteMpush


The small-step version of \ACon{DIP}~$n$~$dp$ takes the top $n$ elements from the stack
and starts executing the program $dp$ followed by 
the new instruction \ACon{mpush}~\textit{front} where
\textit{front} is the list of the $n$ values that were removed from
the stack.
\ConcreteprogStepDIP

The small-step version of \ACon{ITER}~$ip$ just pops the stack if the
list is empty.
Otherwise, if the top contains $v :: vs$, it pops this value, puts $v$
on top of the stack and executes $ip$ followed by
\ACon{mpush}~[\textit{ vs }] and then \ACon{ITER}~$ip$ and the rest of
the program.
\ConcreteprogStepITER

For illustration, 
\tabref{prog-step:ITER-ADD} gives the stacks and shadow program of
each intermediate state resulting from applying \AFun{prog-step} to
the program in Figure~\ref{fig:ITER-ADD} until program termination
for the given input stack interpretation (omitting \ACon{end} for
readability).
This program adds a list of numbers on top of the stack to the number below.

\subsection{Relation to Big-Step Semantics}
\label{sec:relation-big-step}


Executing a program requires iterating the \AFun{prog-step}
function. Our implementation drives this iteration
by a step counter that is counted
down at each instruction.
\ConcreteprogStepStar

We prove that the original big-step semantics and our small-step
semantics are equivalent in the usual sense.
\BigstepToSmallstep
\BigstepFromSmallstep

\subsection{Contract Execution and Execution Chains}\label{sec:contract-execution}

The \AFun{prog-step} function can execute any Michelson program, not only those that comply
to the typing restrictions of a contract.
But it does not provide a mechanism to update the blockchain after successful contract execution
nor one to execute other blockchain operations which might be emitted by a contract.



To implement these aspects of contract execution, the \ADT{ProgState}
is augmented with further information as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:contract-execution-state}.
\begin{figure}[tp]
  \ConcretePrgRunning
  \ConcreteTransaction
  \ConcreteRunMode
  \ConcreteExecState
  \caption{Contract execution state}
  \label{fig:contract-execution-state}
\end{figure}
The record \ADT{PrgRunning} holds the contracts involved in the current
execution: \ACon{self} is the current contract and \ACon{sender} is
the sender (the account that started the current contract).
% (and makes sure that the executed program will terminate with the expected stacks,
% see \listref{PrgRunning}).
The \ADT{ExecState} holds the \ADT{Blockchain}, where contract execution results are saved,
and a list of pending blockchain transactions to be executed. A value
of type \ADT{Transaction} comprises a list of operations and the
address of the sender of these operations.
The field \ADT{MPstate} encodes the current mode of
execution. \ACon{Run} indicates that a contract is currently executing
the program in \ADT{PrgRunning} where we can take a step. \ACon{Cont}
indicates the transition between one contract and the next; execution
proceeds with the next pending blockchain operation. The $\mathcal{F}$
argument is used by the abstract execution to propagate information
between contract invocations. \ACon{Fail} indicates a failure along
with an error code in its $\mathcal{G}$ argument.

\begin{figure}[tp]
  \ConcreteExecStepProgram
  \caption{Program execution}
  \label{fig:exec-step-1}
\end{figure}
The function {\ConcreteExecStep} maps an execution state to its successor state
just like \AFun{prog-step} did for program states.
It only implements the features mentioned above that cannot be modeled
by the program state alone.
Its definition is too big to include it in full; instead
we briefly explain its implementation, giving each case in the same
order as in the implementation.
% \modulel{03-concrete-execution}{195}.

Figure~\ref{fig:exec-step-1} contains the cases when a contract is executing.
\begin{enumerate}
\item When execution of the current contract has terminated
  (i.e., \ADT{MPstate} is $\ACon{Run}~pr$ and \ADT{ProgState.prg} matches \ADT{end}),
  then intrinsic typing ensures that  the stack interpretation
  contains the emitted blockchain operations \textit{new-ops}
  paired with the new storage value \textit{new-storage}.
  We add the emitted operations to the \ACon{pending} field,
  update the terminated contract's storage on the blockchain, and
  switch to \ADT{RunMode} \ACon{Cont}. 
  % Otherwise the balances of the involved contracts must be updated as well.
  % In either case the emitted operations are appended to the pending operations
  % (together with the address from which they were emitted for later references).
\item In all other cases of a running program, its \ADT{ProgState} evolves using \ADT{prog-step}.
\end{enumerate}
In the remaining cases \ADT{MPstate} is $\ACon{Cont}~\ACon{tt}$ which
means that no contract is currently executed. In this case
\ACon{pending} is checked for other operations to be executed. 
Our model only implements the \ACon{TRANSFER-TOKENS} operation
that initiates a new contract execution.
We perform the following checks in this case:
\begin{itemize}
\item we fail unless the operation was emitted from a valid account;
    % any call on pending has a valid account address
    % \item if the sender account is valid, it must be checked whether the
    %   transfer operation is for the same contract or a different one
    %   %   why
\item we fail unless the type of the parameter matches the input type of the called contract;
  % this is guaranteed for calls on pending
\item we fail unless the target is a valid account;
\item we fail unless the sender's balance
  contains sufficient tokens to support the transfer.
    % first check is needed, but the second is not.
\end{itemize}
The first three cases can never occur during an actual execution of
a Michelson smart contract execution chain:
The \ADT{TRANSFER-TOKENS} instruction only works for values of type
$\Acontract~t$, which ensures validity of the target address and that the
parameter type is $t$. Moreover, operations can only be emitted by valid accounts.
The checks are needed in our model because it does not maintain
information about which addresses are valid contract addresses.
We chose not to include this information as it adds complexity
without contributing to our goal of proving the soundness of symbolic
execution.
